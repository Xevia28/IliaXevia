                                fragmented resources, study alone, or face difficulties collaborating effectively with
                                peers. Existing learning tools tend to focus on rote memorization rather than true
                                comprehension, leaving students feeling overwhelmed, disconnected, and lacking
                                confidence in their academic progress.</p>

                                After analyzing the usability study findings, I refined Elevate’s design to directly
                                address core usability issues and improve the learning experience. To support students
                                looking for fast revision, I introduced a “Quick Review” mode with flashcard previews
                                and summary sheets, helping users prepare more efficiently before assessments. For
                                better pacing, I added time estimates to each lesson and broke dense modules into
                                smaller, digestible parts. The AI tutor was enhanced with sample prompts and an
                                onboarding walkthrough, guiding students on how to engage with the tool effectively. To
                                improve peer collaboration, I implemented auto-matching based on subject interest and
                                recent activity, ensuring students join active groups and discussions. I also updated
                                the interface to clearly label or temporarily hide unfinished content with "Coming Soon"
                                indicators, reducing confusion and maintaining user trust. These refinements
                                collectively enhanced clarity, motivation, and engagement—laying a strong foundation for
                                more personalized learning and future feature iterations.
