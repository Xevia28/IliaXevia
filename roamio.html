                                frustrating. Most students rely on a mix of messaging apps, spreadsheets, and verbal
                                coordination, leading to disorganized plans, last-minute confusion, and unfair cost
                                distribution. There's no single platform that caters specifically to student needs like
                                real-time collaboration, safe destination discovery, and easy cost-sharing.</p>

                                        Students reported that planning group trips was time-consuming due to scattered

                                        momentum during the planning process. A lack of real-time collaboration meant
                                        some group members were left out of decisions or didn't stay informed, leading

                                            first-time users. To avoid overwhelming the user with information, I
                                            separated the Welcome screen from the Destination Explorer and Itinerary
                                            Builder. This approach ensures a smooth and gradual onboarding experience.

                                            usability and clarity. The Home Dashboard serves as the central hub,
                                            offering students immediate access to trip plans, destination suggestions,

                                            discovering a destination and building an itinerary, to inviting friends and
                                            finalizing bookings. Interactive elements like voting on trip stops, viewing
                                            shared expenses, and switching between confirmed vs. pending plans were

                                            hikes, nature spots, food trips).

                                After conducting the usability study, I refined Roamio's design to address key user pain
                                points and enhance the overall experience. I introduced budget and activity-based
                                filters to make destination discovery more relevant and efficient, reducing decision
                                fatigue. To improve group coordination, I added visual indicators for itinerary
                                updates—such as pending and confirmed status—to ensure all members were aligned. The
                                cost-splitting feature was also updated with per-person summaries and clear payment
                                breakdowns, making shared expenses more transparent and fair. Additionally, I
                                streamlined the group invitation process by enabling one-click sharing via a link, which
                                significantly simplified collaboration. To avoid confusion from blank pages, I
                                implemented placeholder messages like "No reviews yet" to maintain user trust and
                                clarity. These refinements helped create a smoother, more intuitive planning flow, and
                                set the foundation for future iterations including visual styling and onboarding
                                enhancements.
