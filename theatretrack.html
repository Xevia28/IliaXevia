                                TheaterTrack is a user-focused seat reservation app that enhances the movie-going
                                experience from start to finish. It brings together effortless seat selection, smooth
                                group coordination, and tailored loyalty rewards in one unified platform. Whether you're
                                catching a film alone or organizing a night out with friends, TheaterTrack simplifies
                                scheduling, helps you choose the perfect seats, and rewards you along the way. With a
                                focus on ease and collaboration, it transforms how users plan and enjoy their theater
                                visits.

                                Our movie seat reservation app is designed to make planning theater visits more seamless
                                and inclusive. With real-time group coordination, users can easily synchronize with
                                friends or family, ensuring everyone agrees on seat selections without the usual
                                back-and-forth. Interactive 3D seat previews provide a clear, immersive view of the
                                theater layout, helping users confidently choose the best available seats. Additionally,
                                built-in accessibility filters allow users to prioritize features such as wheelchair
                                access, companion seating, or proximity to amenities, making the experience more
                                inclusive for all moviegoers. By addressing common frustrations like seat selection
                                anxiety and time-consuming coordination, the app streamlines the entire process—making
                                group outings smoother, faster, and more enjoyable for everyone involved.

                            <h3 class="project-details__content-title miniheader">The Problem</h3>
                            <p class="project-details__desc-para">Planning movie outings with friends is often chaotic
                                and inconvenient. Users typically juggle between multiple apps; messaging platforms,
                                theater websites, and calendars, to find showtimes, check seat availability, and
                                coordinate with others. This scattered process leads to poor communication, double
                                bookings, and missed opportunities to earn loyalty rewards. There’s no single platform
                                that offers seamless group coordination, real-time seat selection, and integrated
                                incentives, all in one place.</p>

                            <p class="project-details__desc-para">To design and build TheaterTrack, a user-centric movie
                                seat reservation app that streamlines group planning. The platform allows users to
                                easily browse showtimes, reserve seats together, coordinate plans in real-time, and earn
                                loyalty points, all within one intuitive experience. The aim was to reduce the friction
                                of group movie planning while enhancing the booking journey with social and reward-based
                                features.</p>

                                            especially for new users. To minimize cognitive overload, I separated the

                                            features. This separation allowed for a smoother and more focused entry

                                            Using Figma’s prototyping tools, I created interactive low-fidelity flows to
                                            simulate the core user journey—from selecting a movie and reserving seats,
                                            to inviting friends and confirming a group booking. Emphasis was placed on
                                            real-time seat visibility, notification of group responses, and the ability
                                            to split payments or redeem rewards. These interactions helped shape

                                After conducting the usability study, I refined TheaterTrack’s design to address key
                                user pain points and improve the overall booking experience. I introduced genre and
                                theater-location filters to simplify movie discovery and reduce scrolling. To clarify
                                seat selection, I added labeled rows and color-coded seat availability with tooltips
                                explaining seat statuses, reducing accidental bookings. The checkout process was
                                streamlined by making the "Checkout" button sticky and adding a quick-access loyalty
                                points counter on the Home Page to promote easier navigation and faster decisions. To
                                declutter the interface, I prioritized core actions like booking and hid secondary
                                features to reduce cognitive load. Finally, I enhanced group booking coordination by
                                enabling sharing of QR code tickets via text or email and added support for group
                                bookings where one user can reserve seats and share tickets directly. These refinements
                                created a clearer, more intuitive flow and laid groundwork for future enhancements such
                                as onboarding tutorials and personalized recommendations. </p>
